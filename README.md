# OWClock
This mod adds a clock overlay to Outer Wilds. It can be set to count up, or down to the sun exploding.

There's also an additional event logging system; upcoming events defined in `events.json` are displayed above the clock, turning red as they approach.
New eents can be added from the pause menu (tmestamp will be set to the current loop time).
